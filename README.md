## 🔍 About
Welcome to **Python Playground** — a collection of **fun and practical Python projects** that I've built while learning Python! 🖥️

This repository is the result of completing the **100 Days of Code Challenge** from the **Python Pro Bootcamp** by App Brewery. Each day, I learned a new concept and applied it in a real-world project. Whether it's automating tasks with Selenium, creating games like **Snake** 🐍, or analyzing data with **Pandas**, there’s something for every Python enthusiast here!

These projects are meant to:
- **Showcase** practical Python skills.
- **Inspire** you to code your own projects.
- **Help** you learn and master Python by building fun and useful things.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
These are the powerful tools and libraries I've worked with during my journey:

- **Python 3** (of course! 😉)
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
  - **Web Development**: Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, APIs, REST
  - **Automation**: Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests, PyAutoGUI
  - **GUI Development**: Tkinter
  - **Game Development**: Turtle, Pygame
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Other Tools**:
  - **Jupyter Notebooks** & **Google Colab** for data science
  - **Heroku** & **GitHub Pages** for deployment
