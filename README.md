# PythonPlayground

Welcome to **PythonPlayground**, a personal repository showcasing my journey through the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp**. This space is dedicated to my practice projects, coding challenges, and experiments as I deepen my understanding of Python programming.

## 🚀 About This Repository
In this playground, you'll find a variety of Python tasks and projects that reflect the skills and concepts I've learned throughout the bootcamp. Each work is organized in separate folders, making it easy to navigate and explore my progress.

## 📅 Tasks
Each folder corresponds to a task in the bootcamp and contains:
- **`task.py`**: The main Python file for that task, demonstrating the concepts learned.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features and usage guidelines.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore my projects! Here’s how you can get started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MogharedWahid/PythonPlayground.git
2. Navigate to the desired day's folder and run the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   cd PythonPlayground/desired_task
   python task.py

## 🎯 Goals
* Skill Development: To enhance my Python programming skills through consistent practice.
* Portfolio Creation: To build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my growth and understanding of programming concepts.
* Documentation: To document my learning journey for future reference and to help others who may be learning Python.
