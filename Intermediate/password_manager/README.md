- **Clipboard Copy:** Automatically copies the generated password to your clipboard for easy use.
- **Error Handling:** Alerts the user if any required fields are left empty and requests confirmation before saving data.
- **Intuitive GUI:** Built using Tkinter, the interface is simple and user-friendly.

1. **Generate a Password**: 
   - Click on the **"Generate Password"** button to create a random password. 
   - The password will contain a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
   - The generated password will automatically be copied to your clipboard.

2. **Enter Website and Email**:
   - Fill in the **Website** and **Email/Username** fields with the appropriate details for the account you wish to save.

3. **Save Data**: 
   - After entering the details, click on the **"Add"** button.
   - You will be prompted to confirm whether you want to save the website, email, and password.
   - The information will be saved to a `data.txt` file.

4. **View Saved Data**: 
   - The saved website, email, and password entries will be stored in the `data.txt` file in the following format:
     ```website_name | email | password```


## Example of `data.txt` File

## Code Overview

### Password Generation
The `generate_pass()` function randomly selects letters, symbols, and numbers to create a secure password. The length of each type is randomized, and the components are shuffled before being joined to form the final password.

### Saving Password
The `add_pass()` function retrieves the website, email, and password entered by the user. It checks if any fields are empty and prompts the user for confirmation before saving the data to a `data.txt` file.

### User Interface
The GUI is created using Tkinter:
- A logo is displayed at the top of the window.
- Fields to input website names, emails, and passwords.
- Buttons to generate passwords and save data.
